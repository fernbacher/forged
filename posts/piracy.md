## DO NOT USE

### 1. Not Recommended Sites for Pirating Games
It is advised to avoid:
* Any website labeled in a way which includes names of scene groups such as CODEX, CPY, RELOADED, SKIDROW and / or others.
* Sites often flagged as risky, including but not limited to:
    * `agfy.co`
    * `alltorrents.co`
    * `Cracked-games.org`
    * `crackingpatching.com`
    * `freetp.org`
    * `gamesforyou.co`
    * `getgamez.net`
    * `IGG-Games.com`
    * `loadgames.org`
    * `nosteamgames.ro`
    * `oceanofgames.com`
    * `pcgamestorrents.com`
    * `rgmechanics.com`
    * `steamcracked.co`
    * `steamhub.co`
    * `thepiratebay` (The popular site has many unsafe proxies/mirrors)
    * `steamunlocked`
* *This list is not exhaustive; the piracy realm is filled with scammers.*

### 2. uTorrent
* **Reason:** Has been reported to bundle unwanted software (e.g., a cryptocurrency miner) in the past. The company developing this software has faced trust issues. ([Source Example](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/utorrent-silently-installing-bundled-bitcoin-mining-software-2931825))
* **Note:** "Bittorrent" (the torrent client) is owned by the same company. This is distinct from the open-source and generally recommended qBittorrent.
